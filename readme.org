* WIP minyez.space

The source files of my new personal website.
The [[https://shigaro.org][old site]] (source [[https://github.com/minyez/minyez.github.io/tree/hexo][here]]) was built with Hexo,
and I cannot update it due to my broken npm dependencies.
Since I am now using emacs with org-mode and org-roam for taking notes and writing,
I decide to try out Hugo as the static website generator
with the help of ox-hugo exporter to convert org-mode files to markdown.

Things to do:

- choose/customize a theme
  - scrollable sidebar TOC 
  - multi-lingual support (?)
  - Disqus support for comments
  - MathJax/KaTeX support for LaTeX input
  - light/dark theme switch
  - no/minimal framework dependencies
- file extraction from my private org-roam repo
- workflow (run emacs batch, hugo, etc) to build site by git push
